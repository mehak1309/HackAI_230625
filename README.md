## Getting Started

### 1. Navigate to the Settings Page

Here, you can provide essential information for the currencies you wish to monitor:

- Input your API key.
- Specify the base currency.
- Define the foreign currency.
- Set your desired threshold.
- Complete the process by clicking the submit button.

### 2. Navigate to the Currency Monitor Page
When you navigate to the Currency Monitor Page, you'll encounter a dynamic bar chart. You have the flexibility to choose the graph view, whether for frequency or exchange rates, for the foreign currencies you selected earlier. Additionally, you can customize the foreign currencies displayed. The graph updates in real-time, providing you with the most current data.

On the right-hand side, you'll find alert notifications accompanied by sound cues. These alerts promptly notify you when the foreign currencies either surpass or dip below the threshold values set by the user.


## Database

This project relies on two essential datasets in CSV format:

- **currency_codes.csv:** This dataset comprises three-letter currency codes, enhancing the frontend user experience by providing easy access to currency information.

-  **user_data.csv:** Within this dataset, you'll find the information entered by users in forms, encompassing details related to foreign countries, thresholds, and more. It plays a crucial role in shaping the user experience and functionality of the application.
